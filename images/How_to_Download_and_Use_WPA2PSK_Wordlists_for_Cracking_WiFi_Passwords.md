# How to Download and Use WPA2-PSK Wordlists for Cracking WiFi Passwords
 
WPA2-PSK is a common security protocol for wireless networks. It uses a pre-shared key (PSK) that is either a passphrase or a hexadecimal string. To crack WPA2-PSK passwords, you need a wordlist that contains possible PSKs that the target network might be using.

A wordlist is a collection of words or phrases that are commonly used as passwords or passphrases. Wordlists can be generated from various sources, such as dictionaries, websites, leaked databases, etc. Some wordlists are specially designed for cracking WPA2-PSK passwords, and they follow the rules of 8-63 characters in length.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use some of the best WPA2-PSK wordlists available on the internet. These wordlists are compiled from various sources and contain millions of words that can be used for dictionary attacks using tools such as Aircrack-ng, Hashcat, etc.
 
## Downloading WPA2-PSK Wordlists
 
There are many websites that offer WPA2-PSK wordlists for download. Some of them are:
 
- [GitHub - kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists](https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists): A collection of wordlists dictionaries for password cracking[^1^]
- [WPA WPA2 Word List - 982,963,904 Words - Hak5 Forums](https://forums.hak5.org/topic/29308-13gb-44gb-compressed-wpa-wpa2-word-list-982963904-words/): A 13GB wordlist that contains 982,963,904 words[^2^]
- [GitHub - david-palma/wifi-cracking](https://github.com/david-palma/wifi-cracking): A repository that contains scripts and wordlists for cracking WiFi passwords[^3^]

You can download these wordlists using a torrent client or a web browser. Some of them are compressed in ZIP or RAR format, so you need to extract them before using them.
 
## Using WPA2-PSK Wordlists
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted the wordlists, you can use them with any tool that supports dictionary attacks on WPA2-PSK passwords. One of the most popular tools is Aircrack-ng, which is a suite of programs that can capture, analyze, and crack WiFi packets.
 
To use Aircrack-ng with a wordlist, you need to follow these steps:

1. Capture the handshake of the target network using airodump-ng or any other tool that can capture WiFi packets.
2. Save the captured handshake in a file with a .cap or .pcap extension.
3. Run aircrack-ng with the -w option and specify the path to the wordlist file and the handshake file. For example: `aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt /path/to/handshake.cap`
4. Wait for Aircrack-ng to try all the words in the wordlist against the handshake. If it finds a match, it will display the PSK of the target network.

Note that cracking WPA2-PSK passwords can take a long time depending on the size of the wordlist and the speed of your computer. You can speed up the process by using multiple wordlists or by using GPU-based tools such as Hashcat.
 
## Conclusion
 
WPA2-PSK is a widely used security protocol for wireless networks. To crack WPA2-PSK passwords, you need a wordlist that contains possible PSKs that the target network might be using. In this article, we showed you how to download and use some of the best WPA2-PSK wordlists available on the internet. These wordlists are compiled from various sources and contain millions of words that can be used for dictionary attacks using tools such as Aircrack-ng
